                  Don has extensive experience in medical instrumentation, hardware and software design and has over 30 patents in his name.
                  Don worked for over 19 years at Marquette  and GE  Medical Systems as a software and hardware electrical
                  engineer. Before joining APN health he had worked for over 7 years as a principle engineer at GE Healthcare
                  where he guided company product strategy. Don's extensive experience was instrumental in designing automated
                  algorithms for cycle length, local activation times and voltage detection as well as other complex algoriths.

                  An electronics engineer with over 25 years of direct experience in designing multichannel impedance systems. John is one
                  of the most accomplished engineers in the field of impedance mapping and was one of the pioneers in designing
                  algorithms for full impedance system and impedance based respiration gating and compensation. He worked
                  as a research scientist for 11 years at CPI and subsequently as a senior engineer at St. Jude  Medical
                  for 22 years. He has authored or co-authored over 70 allowed patents. John is a Senior Member of IEEE and
                  IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society as well as many other prestigious societies.
